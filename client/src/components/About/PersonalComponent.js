            Hey there! I'm Raul Maya, a dedicated web developer and data
            engineer with a passion that's only rivaled by my love for coffee.
            Each cup fuels my creativity, helping me craft seamless digital
            solutions. Based in vibrant Mexico, I cherish moments with my
            family, our Shih-Tzu being the star, of course. While football
            captures my athletic side, my intellectual pursuits involve
            assembling intricate Lego Technic sets and delving into suspenseful
            reads, with "The Analyst" by John Katzenbach being a recent
            favorite. With a blend of technical prowess and a rich palette of
            interests, I strive to bring a unique perspective to every project.
